| [**Sprint1**](https://github.com/BrandonScottt/Data_projects_TripleTen/tree/main/Sprint01_The_Golden_Age_of_TV) | This project investigates how IMDb votes influence the ratings of TV shows from the Golden Age of Television, starting in 1999 with the release of *The Sopranos*. The goal is to determine if highly-rated shows from this era also have a higher number of votes.  |
| [**Sprint2**](https://github.com/BrandonScottt/Data_projects_TripleTen/tree/main/Sprint02_Instacart_Customer_Behavior) | In this project, you will analyze data from Instacart, a grocery delivery platform. The dataset, originally released for a Kaggle competition in 2017, has been modified to include missing and duplicate values for your analysis. Your goal is to clean the data and generate insights into Instacart customers' shopping habits.  |
| [**Sprint3**](https://github.com/BrandonScottt/Data_projects_TripleTen/blob/main/Sprint03_Telecom_Prepaid_Plans/README.md) | You work as an analyst for the telecom operator Megaline. The company offers its clients two prepaid plans, Surf and Ultimate. The commercial department wants to know which of the plans brings in more revenue to adjust the advertising budget. You will carry out a preliminary analysis of the plans based on data from 500 Megaline clients. This dataset includes information on client demographics, plan usage, and revenue generation. Your task is to analyze client behavior and determine which prepaid plan brings in more revenue.  |
| [**Sprint4**](https://github.com/BrandonScottt/Vehicle_US) | This project is tasked to create an interactive dashboard that allows users to explore the "Vehicle US" dataset, providing visualizations and insights into key aspects of the dataset related to vehicles being sold in the United States.  |
| [**Sprint5**](https://github.com/BrandonScottt/Data_projects_TripleTen/tree/main/Sprint05_Video_Game_Sales) | You work for the online store Ice, which sells video games all over the world. User and expert reviews, genres, platforms (e.g., Xbox or PlayStation), and historical data on game sales are available from open sources. Your task is to identify patterns that determine whether a game succeeds or not. This analysis will help spot potential big winners and plan advertising campaigns for 2017.  |
| [**Sprint6**](https://github.com/BrandonScottt/Data_projects_TripleTen/tree/main/Sprint06_Chicago_Taxi_Rides) | This project involves analyzing taxi ride data in Chicago. You have been provided with two datasets containing information on taxi companies, ride counts, and drop-off locations. The goal is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns, visualize data, and test hypotheses related to ride duration based on weather conditions. |
| [**Sprint7**](https://github.com/BrandonScottt/Data_projects_TripleTen/tree/main/Sprint07_Megaline_Mobile_Plan_Classification) | Megaline, a mobile carrier, has identified that many of their subscribers are still using legacy plans. To encourage users to switch to one of their newer plans, Smart or Ultra, Megaline needs a model that can analyze subscribers' behavior and recommend the most suitable plan. This project focuses on developing a classification model that can accurately predict whether a subscriber should switch to the Smart or Ultra plan based on their monthly usage data.  |
| [**Sprint8**](https://github.com/BrandonScottt/Data_projects_TripleTen/tree/main/Sprint08_Beta_Bank_Customer_Churn_Prediction) | Beta Bank is facing an issue with customer churn, as customers are gradually leaving the bank. To address this, the goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a customer will leave the bank soon. By accurately predicting churn, Beta Bank can focus on retaining existing customers, which is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. The key objective is to develop a model with the highest possible F1 score, achieving a minimum threshold of 0.59 on the test set. Additionally, the AUC-ROC metric will be measured and compared with the F1 score to evaluate the model's performance.  |
| [**Sprint9**](https://github.com/BrandonScottt/Data_projects_TripleTen/tree/main/Sprint09_OilyGiant_Oil_Wells) | You work for the OilyGiant mining company. Your task is to find the best place for a new oil well.  |
| [**Sprint10**](https://github.com/BrandonScottt/Data_projects_TripleTen/tree/main/Sprint10_Gold_Recovery_Efficiency) | In this project, we aim to develop a model to predict the efficiency of gold recovery in mining operations. The data provided includes various stages of the gold recovery process, including raw feed, rougher concentrate, and final concentrate. The goal is to ensure accurate predictions by thoroughly preparing and analyzing the data before building the model.  |
| [**Sprint11**](https://github.com/BrandonScottt/Data_projects_TripleTen/tree/main/Sprint11_Sure_Tomorrow_Insurance) | The Sure Tomorrow insurance company aims to leverage Machine Learning to tackle several key tasks. Task 1: Identify customers who are similar to a given customer. This will aid the company's agents in targeted marketing efforts. Task 2: Predict whether a new customer is likely to receive an insurance benefit. We will compare the performance of a trained prediction model against an untrained dummy model to determine if machine learning can offer improved predictions. Task 3: Predict the number of insurance benefits a new customer is likely to receive using a linear regression model. Task 4: Implement a data transformation algorithm to protect clients' personal data while maintaining the performance of the linear regression model from Task 3. This will involve data masking or obfuscation to ensure privacy without degrading model quality. |
| [**Sprint12**](https://github.com/BrandonScottt/Data_projects_TripleTen/tree/main/Sprint12_Rusty_Bargain_Car_Value) | Rusty Bargain, a used car sales service, is developing an app to attract new customers by allowing them to quickly find out the market value of their cars. This project involves building a machine learning model to determine the value of a car based on historical data, including technical specifications, trim versions, and prices. Rusty Bargain is particularly interested in the quality of the prediction, the speed of the prediction, the time required for training the model.  |
| [**Sprint13**](https://github.com/BrandonScottt/Data_projects_TripleTen/blob/main/Sprint13_Sweet_Lift_Taxi/README.md) | Sweet Lift Taxi company has collected historical data on taxi orders at airports. The objective of this project is to predict the number of taxi orders for the next hour. This will assist in attracting more drivers during peak hours. The model's performance will be evaluated using the RMSE metric, with a target to keep it below 48 on the test set. |
| [**Sprint14**](https://github.com/BrandonScottt/Data_projects_TripleTen/tree/main/Sprint14_Imdb_Movie_Reviews) | The Film Junky Union, a community for classic movie enthusiasts, is developing a system to automatically filter and categorize movie reviews. The objective is to build a model that classifies reviews as positive or negative using a dataset of IMDB movie reviews with polarity labels. The goal is to achieve an F1 score of at least 0.85. |
| [**Sprint15**](https://github.com/BrandonScottt/Data_projects_TripleTen/tree/main/Sprint15_Age_Predictions) | Good Seed, a supermarket chain, wants to ensure compliance with alcohol laws by verifying the age of customers purchasing alcohol. The goal is to build and evaluate a model that can accurately determine a person's age from a photograph to ensure that they are not underage. |
| [**Sprint16**](https://github.com/BrandonScottt/Data_projects_TripleTen/tree/main/Sprint17_Interconnect_Client_Churn_Prediction) | Interconnect, a telecom operator, aims to forecast client churn to proactively retain customers by offering promotional codes and special plans. This project involves analyzing client data to predict whether a user is likely to leave, using various personal and service-related information. |
