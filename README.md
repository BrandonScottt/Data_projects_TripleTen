| [**Sprint1**](https://github.com/BrandonScottt/Data_projects_TripleTen/tree/main/Sprint01_The_Golden_Age_of_TV) | This project investigates how IMDb votes influence the ratings of TV shows from the Golden Age of Television, starting in 1999 with the release of *The Sopranos*. The goal is to determine if highly-rated shows from this era also have a higher number of votes.  |
