## Project Description

The Sure Tomorrow insurance company aims to leverage Machine Learning to tackle several key tasks. This project involves evaluating the potential of using machine learning models to solve the following tasks:

1. **Task 1:** Identify customers who are similar to a given customer. This will aid the company's agents in targeted marketing efforts.
2. **Task 2:** Predict whether a new customer is likely to receive an insurance benefit. We will compare the performance of a trained prediction model against an untrained dummy model to determine if machine learning can offer improved predictions.
3. **Task 3:** Predict the number of insurance benefits a new customer is likely to receive using a linear regression model.
4. **Task 4:** Implement a data transformation algorithm to protect clients' personal data while maintaining the performance of the linear regression model from Task 3. This will involve data masking or obfuscation to ensure privacy without degrading model quality.

## Data Description

The dataset consists of the following features:

- **Gender:** The insured person's gender.
- **Age:** The insured person's age.
- **Salary:** The insured person's salary.
- **Number of Family Members:** The number of family members associated with the insured person.
- **Target:** The number of insurance benefits received by the insured person over the last five years.

## Answer these questions:
- Check that the data is free of issues â€” there is no missing data, extreme values, and so on.
- Work on each task and answer the questions posed in the project template.
- Draw conclusions based on your experience working on the project.
