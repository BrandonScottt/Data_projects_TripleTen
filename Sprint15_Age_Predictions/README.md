## Project Overview

Good Seed, a supermarket chain, wants to ensure compliance with alcohol laws by verifying the age of customers purchasing alcohol. The goal is to build and evaluate a model that can accurately determine a person's age from a photograph to ensure that they are not underage.

## Data Description

- **Dataset**: Photographs of individuals with their ages indicated.
- **Features**:
  - `Images` - Photographs of individuals.
  - `Age` - The indicated age of the individual in each photograph.
 
## Answer these questions:
- Perform exploratory data analysis to get an overall impression of the dataset.
- Train and evaluate the model (it needs to be done on the GPU platform).
- Combine your code, output and findings (from the previous points) in the final Jupyter notebook.
- Make conclusions of the model evaluation, add them to the notebook.
